# Singlepage - a classy one-page website.

This is an all in one-page website that I've created using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript (with JQuery). My objective was to test some UI and UX ideas that I had at the time and also test my organization and creativity capabilities. Some of the features created in this web site are the slideshow, the option to change from light to dark mode (back and forth), and the adaptability of the elements in different screens using media query.
