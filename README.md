# Singlepage - a classy one-page website.

This is an all-in-one-page website that I've created using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with JQuery). My objective was to test some UI and UX ideas I had at the time and my organization and creativity capabilities.
Some features of this simple one-page site are, the slideshow, the option to change the theme from light to dark mode, and the adaptability of the page on different screen sizes using media query.
